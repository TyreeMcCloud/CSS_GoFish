            <h2>How to Play Go Fish</h2>
                <p>Go Fish is a simple and fun card game for 2-6 players. The goal of the game is to collect sets of four cards of the same rank. Here's how to play:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Each player is dealt 5 cards (7 cards if only 2 players).</li>
                    <li>The remaining cards are placed face down in the center to form the draw pile.</li>
                    <li>Players take turns, starting with the player to the left of the dealer.</li>
                    <li>On their turn, a player asks another player if they have a specific rank of card (e.g., "Do you have any 3s?").</li>
                    <li>If the other player has one or more cards of the requested rank, they must give all of them to the asking player.</li>
                    <li>If the player does not have any cards of the requested rank, they say "Go Fish!" and the asking player draws a card from the draw pile.</li>
                    <li>If the drawn card is the rank they asked for, the player gets another turn. Otherwise, the next player takes their turn.</li>
                    <li>Players form a "book" when they collect 4 cards of the same rank and place it face up in front of them.</li>
                    <li>The game continues until all 13 books have been made.</li>
                    <li>The player with the most books at the end of the game wins!</li>
                </ol>
